This programming exercise serves as:
1. a study review of the first part of Ch 5 on Irvine's library, mainly I/O procedures - they will be useful for future assignments
2. code reading and the application of it
3. putting additional test run on your development tools setup

After having finished Ch 5.1 - 5.3 ( up to PowerPoint slide #20 in Module 2 ) , Do the Followings:
1) Download and Read this program and understand what it does: apply_Irvine_libs_tmpl.asm Download apply_Irvine_libs_tmpl.asm  ; it is the template(base code) for your programming exercise and it has some blank lines, marked by "underlines _________"; you can read Ch 5.4 of the text or, download this Help Manual to read more about the specifications and the argument format/requirements for Procedures invocation : IrvineLibHelp.chm Download IrvineLibHelp.chm
