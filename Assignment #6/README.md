# Programming Exercise 1 - SIMPLE ADDITION [10 pts]

Write a program that 1) clears the screen, 2) locates the cursor near the middle of the screen, 3) prompts the user for two integers, 4) adds the integers, and 5) displays their sum; all of the prompts and output line should be displays should be at the middle of the screen, line by line.

Hint: Use the Gotoxy procedure from Irvine32.lib to locate the cursor on the screen; see PowerPoint slide #9 of Ch 5, in Module 6, and Section 5.4 in the text.

Sample Output:

![]()

 

# Programming Exercise 2 - RANDOM STRINGS [15 pts]

Create a procedure that generates a random string of length L, containing all capital letters. When calling the procedure, pass the value of L in EAX, and pass a pointer to an array of bytes that will hold the random string. Write a test program that calls your procedure 20 times and displays the strings in the console window.

Sample Output:


![]()
 

# Programming Exercise 3 - COLOR MATRIX [15 pts]

Write a program that displays a single character in all possible combinations of foreground and background colors (combinations: 16Ã—16 = 256). The colors are numbered from 0 to 15, so you can use a nested loop to generate all possible combinations.

Sample Output:

![]()
